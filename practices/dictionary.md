## Practice Questions for python dictionary

1\. Write a Python script to add a key-value pair to a dictionary
---

```
mydict = {0: 10, 1: 20}
# read input from the user
# let the user input the key
# let the user input the value
# add new key-value pair
# print out the dictionary
```

2\. Write a Python program to iterate over dictionaries using for loops
---

```
mydict = {0: 10, 1: 20, 2:30, 3:40}
# Use for loop to iterate through the dictionary
# print every key-value pair in the dictionary
```

3\. Write a Python script to print a dictionary where the keys are numbers between 1 and 15 (both included) and the values are square of keys.
---

```
mydict = {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64, 9: 81, 10: 100, 11: 121, 12: 144, 13: 169, 14: 196, 15: 225}
# iterate through the dictionary
# if keys are between 1 and 15
#     print
# if values are square of keys
#     print
```
